# VL.ColourLovers

## Achtung

This is still a work in progress ! The mouse hook lib I'm using to catch the global mouse position seems to crash gamma for some reason, will have to investigate this.

## Was ist das

A small utility node that allows to search for color palettes from ColourLovers (either by keyword or by color) and retrieve them easily in your patch. More documentation will follow when the project is in a more stable state.
